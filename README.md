# NeuralNetwork-vanilla
A vanilla neural network implementation using NumPy and TensorFlow building blocks.

The Neural network models have the following specifications : 

	1. 1 hidden layer
	
	2. 5 nodes in the hidden layer
	
	3. Gradient Decent used as loss
	
	4. Learning rate is constant
	
	5. Sigmoid is used as the activation functon
	
	6. Linear (Wx + b) operation applied at nodes
	
The models instantiated in the notebooks are trained on a 3 bit XOR gate function.

input dimension : [8 x 3]

output dimension : [8 x 1]
